# hvac-tiny
A wrapper for the hvac module giving a simpler interface

# WTF?
I use [hvac](https://github.com/hvac/hvac) in my everyday work and the official client basically provides a lot of bricks for building youown local client for your tasks and evironment. And it's OK.

However I recon there is a little problem and I want to code a tiny client using hvac (not bare Vault API) with a simplier to use interface based on my expirience with Vault and hvac.
